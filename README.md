# automated-Blinds-Arduino-Smartthings-Shield-Servo-on-existing-2inch-blinds
Attempting to build some automated blind controls and integrate them in my Smartthings hub. Using the existing blinds I want to use a servo, Arduino, and a Smartthings shield to use my phone to place my blinds in one of 3 positions, open, closed up, and closed down. I would also like to incorporate a slider to be able to adjust the blinds to any position in between.


Any help with code writing would be much appreciated! This is my first project.

I'm new to this and have no experience with any form of code writing. My goal is to learn and become familiar with the basics of code writing.

Thanks in advance!
